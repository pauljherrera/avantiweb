No assurance can be given that the recommendations of www.avantifs.com and Avanti Servicios Financieros C.A. will be profitable or will not be subject to losses. All Clients should understand that the results of a particular period will not necessarily be indicative of results in future periods. The results listed at this website are based on hypothetical trade results. Hypothetical or simulated performance results have certain inherent limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, simulated trades do not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have not actually been executed, the results may have over or under compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors such as lack of liquidity. You may have done better or worse than the results portrayed. No independent party has audited the hypothetical performance contained at this website, nor has any independent party undertaken to confirm that they reflect the trading method under the assumptions or conditions specified hereafter. While the results presented at this website are based upon certain assumptions believed to reflect actual trading conditions, these assumptions may not include all variables that will affect, or have in the past affected, the execution of trades indicated by www.avantifs.com.<br>

	      You expressly understand and agree that www.avantifs.com and Avanti Servicios Financieros C.A.&nbsp;our employees, our associates&nbsp;shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss or profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses<br>

	       Forex trading has large potential rewards, but also large potential risk. You must be aware of the risks and be willing to accept them in order to invest in the Forex markets. Don't trade with money you can't afford to lose. Nothing in our course or website shall be deemed a solicitation or an offer to Buy/sell any financial vehicle. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those discussed on our site. Also, the past performance of any trading methodology is not necessarily indicative of futures results. Day trading involves high risks and you can lose a lot of money.</p>
	    <p class="style28">We don't have a policy of returning the money or part of the money for payment our services and expert advisors.</p>
	    <p class="style28">Transactions in securities futures, commodity and index futures and Forex carry a high degree of risk. The amount of initial margin is small relative to the value of the futures contract, meaning that transactions are heavily "leveraged". A relatively small market movement will have a proportionately larger impact on the funds you have deposited or will have to deposit: this may work against you as well as for you. Any transaction involving currencies is exposed to, among other things, changes in a country's political condition, economic climate, acts of nature - all of which may substantially affect the price or availability of a given currency. Previous performance is not a guarantee for a future success in Forex trading online.</p>
